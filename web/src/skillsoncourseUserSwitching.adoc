After a relationship has been created and marked as giving access to information with the skillsonCourse portal then you can start creating relationships between contacts.
To do this you have to open up the contact you want to create relationship to, Scroll till you see 'Relation' then click the + button.
From here a sheet will appear that will allow you to choose who you want to create a relationship to along with what type of relationship.
In the example below I am trying to make 'Natalie Morton' the employer of 'James Matthews'.
