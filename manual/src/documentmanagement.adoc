== Document Management

onCourse provides an effortless way to manage your documents. Documents
can be uploaded to onCourse and linked to Courses, Classes, Enrolments,
Contacts, Tutors, Students, Sites and Rooms. Because all documents are
version controlled you will never lose any historic information, making
RTO compliance easy.

Document management in onCourse can be used for lots of purposes:

* Displaying images and other content on your website
* Storing compliance documentation such as tutor resumes and
qualifications
* Maintaining a history of assessment and other enrolment related
compliance
* Distributing information to tutors through the skillOnCourse portal
* Distributing assessments and course material to students

[[documentManagement-Adding]]
=== Adding new documents

You can add new documents directly in the edit view from many places in
onCourse. For example below you can see a Course "Accounting" to which
we want to add a picture of a duck. To do this click the plus symbol
next to the Documents header

You will now be given a choice to find an existing document or upload a
new file. Let's say we want to upload that duck picture from your
computer. You can either click on the 'Browse' button or, if you've
already uploaded the file, type the name you gave it when yous saved it.

Once a file has been selected it will take you to another window that
you can start entering additional information.

There are a number of fields when adding a new document, they are:

* Name - Allows you to change the name of the document.
* Access - This drop down box allows you to choose what access rights
you want to give to the document. For more information please refer to
the Access rights section of this chapter.
* Description - You have the ability to write a short description about
this document.

Adding a tag to this document can be done by clicking where it says 'No
Tags' underneath the main file image.

You can also choose whether duck is allowed to be attached to other
records. If you select this option it will appear in the clairvoyance
name lookup when you are trying to attach an existing document to
another record.

For attachments like contact profile pictures, you may choose not to
allow them to be attached to other records.

[[documentManagement-Attaching]]
=== Attaching existing documents

If you wish to attach an existing document (one which has previously
been uploaded in onCourse) to a record, you will click + in the
attachment list and the sheet below will open. To find an existing
document, named duck, to course ABC you would start typing the name duck
in the clairvoyance field on the left side of the sheet. A list will
then appear with all existing documents in onCourse that contain the
word duck in them. If there aren't any documents that are already stored
in onCourse with the name duck, then no results will be returned.

Once you have found and selected the correct document a new window will

Accounting and the document 'duck'. You'll see the following
information:

By clicking on the 'History' tab you have the ability to view previous
versions of the document 'duck' and view either the records linked to
them or open a previous version of duck. You also have the ability to
upload a new version of duck by clicking on the 'Upload new version'
button at the bottom left side of the sheet. More information on this
can be found on this in the next section, Version Control.

image:images/documentManagement/edit_attachment_history.png[ Version
history of the document ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

[[documentManagement-Versioning]]
=== Version Control

onCourse keeps a history of all files you upload, allowing you to link
records to specific older versions and review the history of your
documents at any time. This makes it easy for you to comply with ASQA
auditing requirements as well as ensuring you never lose an important
document again.

Upload a new version of the document from the edit view shown in the
previous section. You will be given the opportunity to find the file you
wish to upload and replace the existing document. In this scenario you
are trying to upload a new version of the document duck, you are then
shown the following options:

* Below this will be the total number of classes and enrolments that
will be attached to the new version of duck.
* Description of this change - you can write a short description
explaining the reason or differences of this change.
* You can also use the open related record icons to find out more
information about the records linked to the versions of this document
* When uploading a new version of a document it is good practice to make
a short note describing the change between the previous version and this
version. This 'description of change' is available in the document
history version list.

Once you have finished with the above information you can save the
changes made by clicking the 'Ok' button at the bottom right hand side
of the page.

[[documentManagement-specialDocuments]]
=== Special documents

Some parts of onCourse have special handling of documents. At the moment
the only publicly visible example of this is the contact picture. If you
open a contact record (company, tutor, student) in edit view double
click on the image at the top left, you can add your own photo of that
person. A file dialog will appear and you will be able to choose a photo
to add. It will be automatically resized to a thumbnail size before
being stored.

[[documentManagement-accessRights]]
=== Access rights

Each document can have one of several levels of access:

* Public - This gives everyone access to the document and will appear on
your onCourse public website, as part of the sales and marketing
material. When you open this document from inside onCourse, you can send
the URL link for these documents to other users and they will open the
attachment in a browser.
* Private - This means this document will not replicate to the website
or the skillsOnCourse portal. It will only be available to
administrative users of the onCourse software. While a private document
will open in a browser should you click on the link inside onCourse,
this URL contains an access key ID and an expiry period. Should you send
this URL to another person, they will receive an 'access denied' message
if they try to open it. A private document can only be viewed via the
link to it inside the onCourse application.
* Tutors and enrolled students - Both Tutors and enrolled students of
the related course or class can view this document in their
skillsOnCourse portals.
* Tutors only - This means only the tutors of the related course or
class can view this document in their skillsOnCourse portal.
+
Both 'tutor only' and 'tutor and enrolled student' documents opened from
inside the onCourse application will load into a browser with URL
containing an access key ID and an expiry period. Should you send this
URL to another person, they will receive an 'access denied' message if
they try to open it.
+
You can send the class tutor or an enrolled student a link to the
document inside the portal to allow them to access it e.g.
https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/resources to access all their
resources, or https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/class/5040367 to
access the resources attached to a specific class, where 5040367 is the
class id in the onCourse web database.
