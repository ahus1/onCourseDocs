=== What is onCourse cloud?

onCourse cloud is a hosted version of onCourse which ish manage and maintain on your behalf.

The benefits of a cloud hosted solution include:

* *Hosting of your onCourse server in a Tier 3 data centre located in Australia.* ish directly manages the hardware and software, with the data centre providing redundant links to the internet.
All networking equipment is fully redundant, and the database clustered across primary and slave machines.
If your primary office loses power or internet, remote access to your onCourse server is still available from other sites.
* *Management of your onCourse server*. ish supply and manage the physical infrastructure that hosts your server, provide offsite backups and manage the upgrade process for you when new versions are released.
You do not need to engage your IT support company for any onCourse related issues or assistance as you may with a locally managed version.
* *Web Browser interface offers simplified user access.* No software to install or maintain - you launch onCourse by going to a URL created just for you.
The software looks and behaves the same as the locally installed version; although you launch the application from inside a browser, you aren't restricted to the simplified user interface of a web application.
The full onCourse user experience is available complete with multiple windows, printing and more.
* **No need to update and install new client software when your server is upgraded.**New versions of the onCourse client software are applied automatically.
* *Staff access to onCourse from anywhere with internet access via the browser.* Home, remote training venues, other offices - there is no need for you to set up and manage VPNs or software installation on multiple machines.
Access is to onCourse is secure from any venue and encrypted with SSL at the same level of encryption as banking systems.
* *A unique database instance for your training organisation.* Every onCourse cloud customer has their own instance of the onCourse server application running.
This means we can upgrade your software when you are ready, and your data is not locked into our solution - your database can be handed over to you for self management at any time should you choose to leave the ish Cloud for a locally managed onCourse option, or if you just want to get at your database.

The 'yourcollege' part will be replaced by whatever code your college is given in our system, which we'll let you know about at the time.
. When you go to the URL you'll be greeted with the following login window.

Proceed to use onCourse as normal, or if this is your first time in the software, explore the user and interface and press all the buttons to see what they do!

== Installing the standalone version of onCourse

onCourse is also available as an installed, standalone application, rather than the cloud version hosted by the vendor.

In order to download and install the standalone application:

* Go to https://www.ish.com.au/download
* Download onCourse Server. There is one application bundle which will work on OSX, Windows, Linux and Unix platforms.
* Install and set up MariaDB 10.3 or higher on your system. Consult their docs to see how to do that. mySQL and postgresql should also work but we only test MariaDB for every release.
* Make sure you have Java 11 or newer installed. We typically use the AdoptOpenJDK distribution here, but any distribution should work OK.
* Edit onCourse.yml to suit your setup and database
* Run onCourse using either the `bin/server.bat` Windows script file or `bin/server` for all other platforms.

Once it is running, you should be able to connect with your browser and login with username "admin", password "admin".
