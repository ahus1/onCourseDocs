		<title>Invoices</title>
		<para>Every time you create a purchase through Quick Enrol, an invoice will be automatically
			created for you. Each item purchased will create an invoice line, so multiple students
			enrolling in multiple classes each can be recorded on a single invoice. An invoice is
			assigned to a debtor, so an employer requesting two students enrolling in three classes
			each can be issued a single invoice through one Quick Enrol process. Whereas two
			individual students each enrolling and paying for their classes themselves would be
			enrolled through two Quick Enrol processes, to create two invoices - one for each
			student.</para>
		<para>During the Quick Enrol process you can see the draft details the invoice you are
			creating, and add additional information like a customer's purchase order number or add
			additional custom lines, such as a surcharge for phone bookings.</para>
		<para>Invoice lines automatically created by Quick Enrol may include purchases of
			enrolments, products, vouchers or memberships.</para>
		<para>Full or partial payment against an invoice may be taken at the time of creation
			through Quick Enrol, or at a later date. A due date for the invoice can be manually set
			in Quick Enrol.</para>
		<para>These invoices are then visible within the Invoice list view. Like all other lists you
			can sort, search, export and print from this view. </para>
		<para>The invoice list view can be opened by typing 'Invoices' into the Find Anything
			search.</para>
		<para>The quick search option in the top left hand corner of the screen allows you to search for
			invoices by debtor last name, company name or invoice number. When you begin typing the
			text into this field, the list of invoices shown will automatically reduce to meet your
			criteria.</para>

			<para>The 'Overdue' column will show the total unpaid component of the invoice that is
				due prior to tomorrow e.g. amounts due today, and in the past, which are unpaid are
				considered overdue. This updates daily, not in real time.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Invoice Terms</title>
			<para>By default, an invoices created by onCourse will have a due date of today i.e.
				their day of creation.</para>
			<para>If you wish to set a different default term for all your invoices, then you can set a
				'default invoice terms (days)' in the Financial preferences, located at Preferences
				> Financial. This is a good choice for organisations who do not usually take payment
				upfront during the enrolment process.</para>
			<para>However, if most of your enrolling students require invoices with a due date of
				'today', and some corporate contacts require invoices with due date terms, you can
				also set invoice terms per contact.</para>
			<para>In the contact record, open the Financial tab and unlock the default invoice
				terms. Replace the value with the customer specific terms.</para>
			<para>All future invoices created for this customer, including invoices created for
				enrolments processed over the website using a corporatePass, will have a due date
				set according to the custom terms.</para>

			<title>Editing Invoices</title>
			<para>Invoices may not be deleted and all of the financial information within an invoice
				may not be edited once created - only the invoice due date and payment plan
				information can be changed. Although this may seem like an inconvenience, immutable
				invoices are extremely important to ensure a robust audit trail and to guarantee the
				integrity of the general ledger transactions.</para>
			<para>If you need to modify an invoice you should instead create a credit note. A credit
				note is an invoice where the invoice lines have negative dollar values. Remember if
				you are cancelling an enrolment or a class there are easier ways to do that from the
				class and enrolment list views.</para>
			<para>A credit note is an invoice with a negative total and is shown alongside invoices
				in the same list view. The owing amounts on an invoice and a credit note are not
				automatically zeroed against each other, however you can cancel them out by using
				the cog wheel option 'contra invoice'.</para>

		<section xml:id="invoice-apply-payment-in">
			<title>Applying a Payment In via Cogwheel</title>
			<para>You can apply a payment in for a specific invoice from the Invoice list view by 
				highlighting a single invoice > clicking the cogwheel > selecting 'Apply payment in'.</para>
			<para>This will open the Quick Enrol screen with the contact field pre-filled and, 
				provided the selected invoice is due on or prior to the current date, the highlighted 
				invoice will be ticked within 'Payments'. If you select an invoice that has a due date 
				beyond the current date, you will need to manually select the invoice to have the payment 
				applied to in the Quick Enrol screen. The total payment amount will be auto-calculated to 
				the balance of the selected invoice.</para>
			<para>You can apply the single payment across multiple invoices by selecting the invoices 
				you wish to have the payment applied to by selecting them in the Payments tab on the quick 
				enrol screens. </para>

		<section xml:id="invoice-create">
			<title>Creating a manual invoice</title>
			<para>While you will usually create an invoice through using Quick Enrol, it is
				sometimes useful to create an invoice without an associated product or enrolment.
				You can easily do that by opening the list of invoices and pressing the plus icon at
				the top right.</para>
			<para>Invoices created manually can have an invoice date in the past or the future,
				although the default setting is today. Invoices created with a date in the past will
				can be created prior to the financial period finalised date. They can only be
				created for unlocked periods. If you create a invoice in the past (or future) the
				general ledger transaction lines will be created for that date. You can not pay an
				invoice though that has a creation date in the future, as it doesn't yet exist with
				an outstanding balance. </para>
			<para>Remember to associate each invoice line with the correct income account code. Once
				you save the invoice you will not be able to change this code. </para>
			<para>Each invoice line can have a discount applied, and that discount can optionally be
				linked to a Cost of Sale (COS) account. If you do not apply the discount to a COS
				account, then the income value posted to the general ledger will be reduced by the
				value of the discount.</para>
			<para>By default, invoices are ticked to 'send email'. This sends the standard invoice
				email template to the debtor contact when you save the record.</para>

		<section xml:id="invoice-linking">
			<title>Link invoice lines to class budgets</title>
			<para>When creating invoice lines you may optionally link each line to a class. This
				will treat the income with the same general ledger pre-paid fees and income deferral
				plan as invoices created by enrolling in the class. This also adds the total of that
				invoice line to the class budget and can be very useful when invoicing a company for
				an entire classroom delivery without recording individual enrolments or need to
				include additional income such as funding in a classes budget. </para>
			<para>Type the course name or code, and select the class code from the drop down list to
				join a manual invoice line to a class budget.</para>

		<section xml:id="invoice-duplicating">
			<title>Duplicating and reversing invoices</title>
			<para>This feature is mostly used to create a credit note when you have cancelled the enrolment,
				but retained the invoice by mistake. These types of enrolments will have the status
				'cancelled' rather than 'credited'. </para>
			<para>Alternatively, you might use this option to 'fix' the fee due post enrolment, if
				the student was charged the wrong fee during the enrolment process and you don't
				want to reverse the enrolment entirely. In this case, you would create a reversed
				invoice for part of the course fee.</para>
			<para>You can also use this process to reverse a credit note that shouldn't have been created.
				The reversal of a credit note will be an invoice. </para>
				<para>If you want to create a copy of an invoice, follow the same process by remove
					the minus signs from the invoice lines.</para>
			<para>Remember, you can't edit or delete 'mistakes' in onCourse invoices, but every invoice or
				credit note can be corrected by creating an equal and opposite reversal action. This
				tool is your shortcut to fixing those sorts of mistakes.</para>
			<para>This feature can only be used on one invoice at a time.</para>

					<listitem><para>If you want this new invoice/credit note to be applied to the class budget and pre-paid fee
							liability process, double click on each invoice line and manually link
