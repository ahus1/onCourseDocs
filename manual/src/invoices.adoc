=== Invoices

Every time you create a purchase through Quick Enrol, an invoice will be automatically created for you.
Each item purchased will create an invoice line, so multiple students enrolling in multiple classes each can be recorded on a single invoice.
An invoice is assigned to a debtor, so an employer requesting two students enrolling in three classes each can be issued a single invoice through one Quick Enrol process.
Whereas two individual students each enrolling and paying for their classes themselves would be enrolled through two Quick Enrol processes, to create two invoices - one for each student.

During the Quick Enrol process you can see the draft details the invoice you are creating, and add additional information like a customer's purchase order number or add additional custom lines, such as a surcharge for phone bookings.

Invoice lines automatically created by Quick Enrol may include purchases of enrolments, products, vouchers or memberships.

Full or partial payment against an invoice may be taken at the time of creation through Quick Enrol, or at a later date.
A due date for the invoice can be manually set in Quick Enrol.

These invoices are then visible within the Invoice list view.
Like all other lists you can sort, search, export and print from this view.

The invoice list view can be opened by typing 'Invoices' into the Find Anything search.

The quick search option in the top left hand corner of the screen allows you to search for invoices by debtor last name, company name or invoice number.
When you begin typing the text into this field, the list of invoices shown will automatically reduce to meet your criteria.

[NOTE]
====
The 'Overdue' column will show the total unpaid component of the invoice that is due prior to tomorrow e.g. amounts due today, and in the past, which are unpaid are considered overdue.
This updates daily, not in real time.

==== Invoice Terms

By default, an invoices created by onCourse will have a due date of today i.e. their day of creation.

If you wish to set a different default term for all your invoices, then you can set a 'default invoice terms (days)' in the Preferences window, in the Financial section.
This is a good choice for organisations who do not usually take payment upfront during the enrolment process.

However, if most of your enrolling students require invoices with a due date of 'today', and some corporate contacts require invoices with due date terms, you can also set invoice terms per contact.

In the contact record, open the Financial tab and unlock the default invoice terms.
Replace the value with the customer specific terms.

All future invoices created for this customer, including invoices created for enrolments processed over the website using a corporatePass, will have a due date set according to the custom terms.

==== Editing Invoices

Invoices may not be deleted and all of the financial information within an invoice may not be edited once created - only the invoice due date and payment plan information can be changed.
Although this may seem like an inconvenience, immutable invoices are extremely important to ensure a robust audit trail and to guarantee the integrity of the general ledger transactions.

If you need to modify an invoice you should instead create a credit note.
A credit note is an invoice where the invoice lines have negative dollar values.
Remember if you are cancelling an enrolment or a class there are easier ways to do that from the class and enrolment list views.

A credit note is an invoice with a negative total and is shown alongside invoices in the same list view.
The owing amounts on an invoice and a credit note are not automatically zeroed against each other, however you can cancel them out by using the cog wheel option 'contra invoice'.

[[invoice-apply-payment-in]]
==== Applying a Payment In via Cogwheel

You can apply a payment in for a specific invoice from the Invoice list view by highlighting a single invoice > clicking the cogwheel > selecting 'Apply payment in'.

This will open the Quick Enrol screen with the contact field pre-filled and, provided the selected invoice is due on or prior to the current date, the highlighted invoice will be ticked within 'Payments'.
If you select an invoice that has a due date beyond the current date, you will need to manually select the invoice to have the payment applied to in the Quick Enrol screen.
The total payment amount will be auto-calculated to the balance of the selected invoice.

You can apply the single payment across multiple invoices by selecting the invoices you wish to have the payment applied to by selecting them in the Payments tab on the quick enrol screens.

[[invoice-create]]
==== Creating a manual invoice

While you will usually create an invoice through using Quick Enrol, it is sometimes useful to create an invoice without an associated product or enrolment.
You can easily do that by opening the list of invoices and pressing the plus icon at the top right.

Invoices created manually can have an invoice date in the past or the future, although the default setting is today.
Invoices created with a date in the past will can be created prior to the financial period finalised date.
They can only be created for unlocked periods.
If you create a invoice in the past (or future) the general ledger transaction lines will be created for that date.
You can not pay an invoice though that has a creation date in the future, as it doesn't yet exist with an outstanding balance.

Remember to associate each invoice line with the correct income account code.
Once you save the invoice you will not be able to change this code.

Each invoice line can have a discount applied, and that discount can optionally be linked to a Cost of Sale (COS) account.
If you do not apply the discount to a COS account, then the income value posted to the general ledger will be reduced by the value of the discount.

By default, invoices are ticked to 'send email'.
This sends the standard invoice email template to the debtor contact when you save the record.

[[invoice-linking]]
==== Link invoice lines to class budgets

When creating invoice lines you may optionally link each line to a class.
This will treat the income with the same general ledger pre-paid fees and income deferral plan as invoices created by enrolling in the class.
This also adds the total of that invoice line to the class budget and can be very useful when invoicing a company for an entire classroom delivery without recording individual enrolments or need to include additional income such as funding in a classes budget.

Type the course name or code, and select the class code from the drop down list to join a manual invoice line to a class budget.

[[invoice-duplicating]]
==== Duplicating and reversing invoices

This feature is mostly used to create a credit note when you have cancelled the enrolment, but retained the invoice by mistake.
These types of enrolments will have the status 'cancelled' rather than 'credited'.

Alternatively, you might use this option to 'fix' the fee due post enrolment, if the student was charged the wrong fee during the enrolment process and you don't want to reverse the enrolment entirely.
In this case, you would create a reversed invoice for part of the course fee.

You can also use this process to reverse a credit note that shouldn't have been created.
The reversal of a credit note will be an invoice.

If you want to create a copy of an invoice, follow the same process by remove the minus signs from the invoice lines.

Remember, you can't edit or delete 'mistakes' in onCourse invoices, but every invoice or credit note can be corrected by creating an equal and opposite reversal action.
This tool is your shortcut to fixing those sorts of mistakes.

This feature can only be used on one invoice at a time.


. Open the invoice list view and single click on the invoice you want to fully or partially reverse.
. Click on the cogwheel and select the option 'Duplicate and reverse invoice'.
. A new invoice window will open.
This will be a duplicate of the original invoice, in reverse. e.g. all the original dollar values will now have negative sign in front of them.
+
image:images/invoice_duplicate.png[ Duplicating an invoice from the cogwheel,scaledwidth=100.0%]
. You can edit the value of every field of the new invoice/credit note, including changing the value the reversal is for, to make it more or less than the original invoice value.
. Note that each invoice line from the original invoice will be reversed.
You can delete invoice lines from this credit note you do not want to reverse e.g. if there were two enrolments on the original invoice and you only want to credit one.
+
image:images/duplicated_and_reversed_invoice_two_lines.png[ This reversed invoice has two invoice lines. Select one and click the minus sign (delete) button to remove it from the invoice.,scaledwidth=100.0%]
. You can also add additional lines to the invoice, with either negative or positive values, for example, if you wanted to manually charge an admin fee, you can add the fee as an additional line with a positive amount.
This will reduce the balance of the credit available to the student.
. If you want this new invoice/credit note to be applied to the class budget and pre-paid fee liability process, double-click on each invoice line and manually link it to the course and class by code.
If this invoice reversal was for an enrolment, you will see the course and class code you need to manually reverse against in the invoice line description.
. By default, this new credit note won't be sent by email to the payer.
Check the option 'send email' if you want a copy to be sent.
. Save and close the new credit note/invoice once you have confirmed all the values are correct.
You can not change any of the data after you have saved it as all financial records are immutable.
. If you wish to use this new credit note to contra pay and existing invoice with a balance outstanding, select in the invoice list, and from the cogwheel choose 'contra invoice'.
A new window will open allowing you to select unpaid invoices from the same contact you can credit against.

==== Invoice payment plans

Invoices have payment plans.
You can learn more about invoices in our invoices chapter.

By default invoices have a due of the day they are created.
Sometimes you will want to allow students to pay for training over a longer period of time.
Using payment plans you can set the amount of the up front deposit and a series of dates for payment of the remainder in instalments.

===== Invoice due dates

An existing or new invoice can be converted to a payment plan by adding payment due dates.
This can be done by firstly either creating a new invoice as mentioned in the section above 'Creating a manual invoice' just stopping before you click on 'Save', or opening an existing invoice.
Then click on the '+' symbol at the top right side of the payment plans / payments table for as many different payment due dates you want to add.

image:images/invoice_add_payment_plans.png[ Manually adding payment plan lines to an invoice,scaledwidth=100.0%]

Once this has been done you can then start editing these payment plan lines starting with the dates you want the payments to be due.
This is done by double clicking on one of the 'today' payment due date fields in the table and changing it to a date that you want the payment to be due by.
Then do the same for the other payment due date fields until they are all setup correctly.

image:images/invoice_edit_payment_due_lines.png[ Editing the date for each of the payment due lines,scaledwidth=100.0%]

Then lastly change the amounts that are due on each of these dates from $0 to your chosen amount.
This is also done by double clicking on the relevant field in the table and editing the fee amount.

image:images/invoice_adding_payment_plans.png[ Invoice with manually added payment due dates and amounts,scaledwidth=100.0%]

It is important that the total of the payment plan amounts equals the amount owing; you will not be able to save the invoice unless they match.
The 'Overdue' column in the Invoices list view will show the total unpaid component of the invoice that is due prior to tomorrow.

You can edit the payment plan amounts and due dates at any time, for example if you grant the student an extension to the payment plan.
