=== What is onCourse cloud?

onCourse cloud is a hosted version of onCourse which ish manage and maintain on your behalf.

The benefits of a cloud hosted solution include:

* *Hosting of your onCourse server in a Tier 3 data centre located in Australia.* ish directly manages the hardware and software, with the data centre providing redundant links to the internet.
All networking equipment is fully redundant, and the database clustered across primary and slave machines.
If your primary office loses power or internet, remote access to your onCourse server is still available from other sites.
* *Management of your onCourse server*. ish supply and manage the physical infrastructure that hosts your server, provide offsite backups and manage the upgrade process for you when new versions are released.
You do not need to engage your IT support company for any onCourse related issues or assistance as you may with a locally managed version.
* *Web Browser interface offers simplified user access.* No software to install or maintain - you launch onCourse by going to a URL created just for you.
The software looks and behaves the same as the locally installed version; although you launch the application from inside a browser, you aren't restricted to the simplified user interface of a web application.
The full onCourse user experience is available complete with multiple windows, printing and more.
* **No need to update and install new client software when your server is upgraded.**New versions of the onCourse client software are applied automatically.
* *Staff access to onCourse from anywhere with internet access via the browser.* Home, remote training venues, other offices - there is no need for you to set up and manage VPNs or software installation on multiple machines.
Access is to onCourse is secure from any venue and encrypted with SSL at the same level of encryption as banking systems.
* *A unique database instance for your training organisation.* Every onCourse cloud customer has their own instance of the onCourse server application running.
This means we can upgrade your software when you are ready, and your data is not locked into our solution - your database can be handed over to you for self management at any time should you choose to leave the ish Cloud for a locally managed onCourse option, or if you just want to get at your database.

==== Installing the standalone version of onCourse on your system

onCourse is also available as an installed, standalone application, rather than the cloud version you access via a browser URL.

In order to download and install the standalone application:

* Go to https://www.ish.com.au/download
* Scroll down to the onCourse Client, then click the version that matches the operating system you're running on your machine
* For Windows:
** Start the download, then run the installer.exe that downloads.
When installation is complete, the icon should appear in your Start Menu.
However, if you're having trouble finding it, you can also search for it in the search bar by searching the term 'onCourse'.
* For Mac OSX:
** Start the download, you can set it to save the file or open it from the location, it doesn't matter.
When the download finishes, drag-and-drop the application file from the folder that opens on to the desktop.
* When the application opens, you'll notice the log-in screen looks very similar to the browser URL version, with a couple of extra fields--Host and Port.
If you have logged in to onCourse before using the browser URL version, these two fields should automatically populate themselves, so you shouldn't need to change anything within them.
* If you notice a 'Server not available' error when you attempt login, it's likely there is something incorrect in one of these fields.
Get in touch with us via our support channel, Squish, and we can check this for you.

==== Troubleshooting login

If you're experiencing username or password issues when logging in, you can ask an admin user at your college to reset your password.
If you experience any other kind of error, or cannot reach the log in page for some reason (that isn't related to your own internet connection) then please https://squish.ish.com.au/servicedesk/customer/portal/4[contact
