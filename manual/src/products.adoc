== Other products

A range of products can be sold through onCourse.
You have already seen how you can create classes and open them for enrolment at any price you set.
In addition to enrolments in classes you can also sell:

* Memberships
* Vouchers
* Products

In this chapter we'll focus on the last of these items: product sales.
For more information on memberships, see <<concessions, Concessions and Memberships>> chapter, and for more information on vouchers see <<vouchers, the Vouchers chapter>>.

Products in onCourse are a simple way to supply additional, defined items during an enrolment sale. onCourse does not manage a stock inventory or the shipping of products.
It is expected that most products will be supplied to the student in person when they attend the class.
